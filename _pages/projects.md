Genshin VTuber
------

Final project of course INF573--Image Analysis and Computer Vision. Implement a real-time Genshin VTuber base on head pose estimation and facial feature point detection. Demonstrated superior accuracy and stability in face recognition and tracking in real-time performance.

Meta-Learning Guided Surrogate Model for Expensive Multi-Objective Optimization
------

Propose a novel meta-learning guided surrogate-assisted multi-objective evolutionary algorithm for expensive multi-objective optimization problems. Acquired some decent results on DTLZ1b problems, primarily validating the availability of the proposed algorithm.
