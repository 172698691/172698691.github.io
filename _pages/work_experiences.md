Design and implement a 3D mesh auto-encoder with the ability to accurately capture the shapes of objects and efficiently compress them into a latent representation. Leveraging latent space has proven highly effective in generative models, as seen in text-to-image models. The potential applications of this auto-encoder are diverse. Primarily, it has the potential to substantially decrease the computational burden on models by facilitating direct operation within the latent space. This not only unlocks the possibility of constructing motion models that work seamlessly on sequences of meshes but also enables the extension of models to handle multiple characters, incorporating interactions between them. Secondly, the latent space can be employed in generative models, facilitating the translation from text/image/video to pose/motion.

**Research Assistant <br> 2022.09--2023.05**

Cooperation with the optical laboratory was established to utilize state-of-the-art generative models for learning the wavelength of light and recovering the spectrum from RGB images. The main responsibilities included building the model, training it with processed data, and evaluating its performance. Successfully achieved spectral recovery of images containing single and dual wavelengths.

**Mechine Learning Intern <br> 2022.08--2022.09**

Primarily responsible for the research and development of vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) cooperation for autonomous vehicles. This technology is implemented through V2VNet, which utilizes a spatially aware graph neural network (GNN) to aggregate information from all nearby vehicles. V2VNet intelligently combines data from different time points and perspectives within the scene. Successfully implemented the vehicle-to-infrastructure cooperation in the CARLA simulation environment and conducted corresponding tests to validate the system's effectiveness.
