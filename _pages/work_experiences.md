**Engineer Intern <br> 2024.03--2024.09**

The primary objective of the internship is to develop lightweight models that reduce computational costs and enable faster updates, while also extending these models to handle the temporal dimension for motion modeling. This involves two key steps: developing a 3D Mesh Auto-Encoder that compresses 3D object shapes into a latent space, significantly reducing memory and computational needs for 3D animations. This compression will enable the processing of sequences of meshes, facilitating tasks like motion recognition and generation, which were previously resource-intensive. Additionally, the internship also explore Skeleton-Cylinder Approximation, combining skeleton-based methods with cylinder-based mesh approximations to represent 3D characters. The goal is to explore how this approach can generalize across different character skeleton architectures, providing an efficient alternative to traditional mesh-based models and simplifying the representation of animated characters.

**Research Assistant <br> 2022.09--2023.05**

Internship in Professor [Di Wang](https://cemse.kaust.edu.sa/people/person/di-wang)'s research group. Cooperation with the optical laboratory was established to utilize state-of-the-art generative models for learning the wavelength of light and recovering the spectrum from RGB images. The main responsibilities included building the model, training it with processed data, and evaluating its performance. Successfully achieved spectral recovery of images containing single and dual wavelengths.

**Mechine Learning Intern <br> 2022.08--2022.09**

Primarily responsible for the research and development of vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) cooperation for autonomous vehicles. This technology is implemented through V2VNet, which utilizes a spatially aware graph neural network (GNN) to aggregate information from all nearby vehicles. V2VNet intelligently combines data from different time points and perspectives within the scene. Successfully implemented the vehicle-to-infrastructure cooperation in the CARLA simulation environment and conducted corresponding tests to validate the system's effectiveness.
